Hello!

My main language is Python, but I am currently learning JavaScript and HTML and all that stuff. 

I focus mostly on [YeeBot](https://github.com/KetchupChips1/YeeBot), but every once in a while I start a new project that I never revisit ever again.

I still don't *completely* understand GitHub, but I expect to be able to learn from just messing around.

KetchupChips1/KetchupChips1 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
